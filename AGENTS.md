# Agent Relay

Real-time agent-to-agent messaging. Output `->relay:` patterns to communicate.

## Sending Messages

**Always use the fenced format** for reliable message delivery:

```
->relay:AgentName <<<
Your message here.>>>
```

```
->relay:* <<<
Broadcast to all agents.>>>
```

**CRITICAL:** Always close multi-line messages with `>>>` on its own line!

## Communication Protocol

**ACK immediately** - When you receive a task, acknowledge it before starting work:

```
->relay:Sender <<<
ACK: Brief description of task received>>>
```

Then proceed with your work. This confirms message delivery and lets the sender know you're on it.

**Report completion** - When done, send a completion message:

```
->relay:Sender <<<
DONE: Brief summary of what was completed>>>
```

## Receiving Messages

Messages appear as:
```
Relay message from Alice [abc123]: Message content here
```

### Channel Routing (Important!)

Messages from #general (broadcast channel) include a `[#general]` indicator:
```
Relay message from Alice [abc123] [#general]: Hello everyone!
```

**When you see `[#general]`**: Reply to `*` (broadcast), NOT to the sender directly.

```
# Correct - responds to #general channel
->relay:* <<<
Response to the group message.>>>

# Wrong - sends as DM to sender instead of to the channel
->relay:Alice <<<
Response to the group message.>>>
```

This ensures your response appears in the same channel as the original message.

If truncated, read full message:
```bash
agent-relay read abc123
```

## Spawning Agents

Spawn workers to delegate tasks:

```
->relay:spawn WorkerName claude "task description"
->relay:release WorkerName
```

## Threads

Use threads to group related messages together. Thread syntax:

```
->relay:AgentName [thread:topic-name] <<<
Your message here.>>>
```

**When to use threads:**
- Working on a specific issue (e.g., `[thread:agent-relay-299]`)
- Back-and-forth discussions with another agent
- Code review conversations
- Any multi-message topic you want grouped

**Examples:**

```
->relay:Protocol [thread:auth-feature] <<<
How should we handle token refresh?>>>

->relay:Frontend [thread:auth-feature] <<<
Use a 401 interceptor that auto-refreshes.>>>

->relay:Reviewer [thread:pr-123] <<<
Please review src/auth/*.ts>>>

->relay:Developer [thread:pr-123] <<<
LGTM, approved!>>>
```

Thread messages appear grouped in the dashboard with reply counts.

## Common Patterns

```
->relay:Lead <<<
ACK: Starting /api/register implementation>>>

->relay:* <<<
STATUS: Working on auth module>>>

->relay:Lead <<<
DONE: Auth module complete>>>

->relay:Developer <<<
TASK: Implement /api/register>>>

->relay:Reviewer [thread:code-review-auth] <<<
REVIEW: Please check src/auth/*.ts>>>

->relay:Architect <<<
QUESTION: JWT or sessions?>>>
```

## Rules

- Pattern must be at line start (whitespace OK)
- Escape with `\->relay:` to output literally
- Check daemon status: `agent-relay status`

# Trail

Record your work as a trajectory for future agents and humans to follow.

## Usage

If `trail` is installed globally, run commands directly:
```bash
trail start "Task description"
```

If not globally installed, use npx to run from local installation:
```bash
npx trail start "Task description"
```

## When Starting Work

Start a trajectory when beginning a task:

```bash
trail start "Implement user authentication"
```

With external task reference:
```bash
trail start "Fix login bug" --task "ENG-123"
```

## Recording Decisions

Record key decisions as you work:

```bash
trail decision "Chose JWT over sessions" \
  --reasoning "Stateless scaling requirements"
```

For minor decisions, reasoning is optional:
```bash
trail decision "Used existing auth middleware"
```

**Record decisions when you:**
- Choose between alternatives
- Make architectural trade-offs
- Decide on an approach after investigation

## Recording Reflections

Periodically step back and synthesize progress:

```bash
trail reflect "Workers aligned on auth approach, API layer progressing well" \
  --confidence 0.8
```

With focal points and adjustments:
```bash
trail reflect "Frontend and backend duplicating validation logic" \
  --focal-points "duplication,ownership" \
  --adjustments "Reassigning validation to backend team" \
  --confidence 0.7
```

**Record reflections when you:**
- Have received several updates and need to synthesize the big picture
- Notice workers or tasks diverging from the plan
- Want to course-correct before continuing
- Are coordinating multiple agents and need to assess overall progress

Reflections differ from decisions: decisions record a specific choice,
reflections record a higher-level synthesis of what's happening and whether
the current approach is working.

## Completing Work

When done, complete with a retrospective:

```bash
trail complete --summary "Added JWT auth with refresh tokens" --confidence 0.85
```

**Confidence levels:**
- 0.9+ : High confidence, well-tested
- 0.7-0.9 : Good confidence, standard implementation
- 0.5-0.7 : Some uncertainty, edge cases possible
- <0.5 : Significant uncertainty, needs review

## Abandoning Work

If you need to stop without completing:

```bash
trail abandon --reason "Blocked by missing API credentials"
```

## Checking Status

View current trajectory:
```bash
trail status
```

## Listing and Viewing Trajectories

List all trajectories:
```bash
trail list
```

View a specific trajectory:
```bash
trail show <trajectory-id>
```

Export a trajectory (markdown, json, timeline, html, pr-summary):
```bash
trail export <trajectory-id> --format markdown
```

## Compacting Trajectories

After a PR merge, compact related trajectories into a single summary:

```bash
trail compact --pr 42
```

Compact by branch:
```bash
trail compact --branch feature/auth
```

Compact by commit range:
```bash
trail compact --commits abc123..def456
```

Compaction consolidates decisions and creates a grouped summary, reducing noise while preserving key decisions.

## Why Trail?

Your trajectory helps others understand:
- **What** you built (commits show this)
- **Why** you built it this way (trajectory shows this)
- **What alternatives** you considered
- **What challenges** you faced

Future agents can query past trajectories to learn from your decisions.
